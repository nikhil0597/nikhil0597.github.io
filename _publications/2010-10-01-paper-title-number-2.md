In this article, we present and analyze a fully discrete second-
order scheme for a general class of non-local system of conservation laws
in multiple spatial dimensions. The method employs a MUSCL-type spatial
reconstruction coupled with Runge-Kutta time integration. We analytically
prove that the proposed scheme preserves the positivity in all the unknowns,
a critical property for ensuring the physical validity of quantities like density,
which must remain non-negative. Additionally, the scheme is proven to exhibit
Lâˆž -stability. Numerical experiments conducted on both the non-local scalar
and system cases illustrate the importance of the second-order scheme when
compared to its first-order counterpart and verify the theoretical results.
