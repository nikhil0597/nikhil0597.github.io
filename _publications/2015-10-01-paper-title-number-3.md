In this article, we propose  a second-order central scheme of the 
Nessyahu-Tadmor-type  for a class of scalar conservation laws with discontinuous flux and present its convergence analysis. Since solutions to problems with discontinuous flux generally do not belong to the space of bounded variation  (BV), we employ the theory of compensated compactness as the primary tool to establish the convergence of approximate solutions. A major component of our analysis involves deriving the maximum principle and showing the  $\mathrm{W}^{-1,2}_{\mathrm{loc}}$ compactness of a sequence constructed from approximate solutions. The latter is achieved through the derivation of several essential estimates on the approximate solutions. Furthermore, by incorporating a mesh-dependent correction term in the slope limiter,  we show that the numerical solutions generated by the proposed second-order scheme converge to the entropy solution. Finally, we validate our theoretical results by presenting numerical examples.
