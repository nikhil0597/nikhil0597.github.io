Since childhood, I have enjoyed learning Mathematics, Science, and Literature. I was an avid reader growing up and once dreamed of becoming a writer. During my undergraduate years, while pursuing Mathematics, I was actively involved in the artistic and literary circles of my college, writing poems, stories and movie reviews and engaging in discussions on literature and films.

Mathematics captivated me during those years, and it has kept me hooked ever since. However, I still occasionally write poetry in Malayalam, and I have recently become more interested in reading non-fiction, particularly the philosophy of science and biology—fields that I find deeply fascinating.

Some movie reviews I wrote (in Malayalam) during my undergraduate days as a member of college film club:
