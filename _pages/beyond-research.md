Since childhood, I have enjoyed learning Mathematics, Science, and Literature. I was an avid reader growing up and once dreamed of becoming a writer. During my undergraduate years, while pursuing Mathematics, I was actively involved in the artistic and literary circles of my college, writing poems, stories and movie reviews and engaging in discussions on literature and films. These are some movie reviews I wrote for a magazine (in Malayalam) during my undergraduate days:
- [Ship of Theseus](https://magazine.assisijeevan.com/p/717)
- [Elle](https://magazine.assisijeevan.com/p/448)

I still occasionally write poetry, and have recently become more interested in reading non-fiction, particularly the philosophy of science and biology—fields that I find deeply fascinating.

## Some books I love
Here are some of my most favorite books that I keep returning to:
- *Anna Karenina* – Leo Tolstoy
- *The Death of Ivan Illyich* - Leo Tolstoy
- *Of Human Bondage* – W. Somerset Maugham
- *Stoner* – John Edward Williams
- *The Brothers Karamazov* – Fyodor Dostoevsky
- *India After Gandhi* - Ramachandra Guha
- *The Beginning Of Infinity* - David Deutsch
- *Sundarikalum Sundaranmaarum* – Uroob  
- *Pattummayude Aadu* – Vaikom Muhammad Basheer
