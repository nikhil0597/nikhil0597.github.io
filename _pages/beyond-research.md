I was an avid reader growing up and once dreamed of becoming a writer. During my undergraduate years, while pursuing Mathematics, I was actively involved in the artistic and literary circles of my college, writing poems, stories and movie reviews and engaging in discussions on literature and films.

Some movie reviews I wrote (in Malayalam) during my undergraduate days as a member of college film club:

- [Elle](https://magazine.assisijeevan.com/p/448)
