Hi there! Welcome to my webpage! I am an applied mathematics researcher working on numerical methods for hyperbolic conservation laws. 

I will be a postdoctoral researcher in the research group of [Prof. Christian Klingenberg](https://ifm.mathematik.uni-wuerzburg.de/~klingen/index.html) at the [University of Würzburg](https://www.uni-wuerzburg.de/en/university/), Germany, starting from November 2025, where I will be working on genuinely multi-dimensional high order finite-volume methods.   

I completed my PhD in Mathematics at the [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Thiruvananthapuram](https://www.iisertvm.ac.in/), India under the supervision of [Dr. Sudarshan Kumar K](https://www.iisertvm.ac.in/faculty/sudarshan). During my PhD, I worked on high-order numerical methods for [non-local conservation laws](https://www.esaim-m2an.org/articles/m2an/abs/2023/06/m2an230129/m2an230129.html) and [conservation laws with discontinuous flux](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04620).
