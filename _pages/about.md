Hi! Welcome to my personal website!

I am a PhD candidate in Mathematics at the [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Thiruvananthapuram](https://www.iisertvm.ac.in/), India.

My research focuses on developing and analyzing numerical schemes to approximate the solutions of hyperbolic conservation laws, a fundamental class of partial differential equations that govern various real-world physical systems. My interests include high-order finite volume schemes, their mathematical stability and convergence analysis, and computational implementation.

Currently, I am working on high-order numerical schemes for [non-local conservation laws](https://www.esaim-m2an.org/articles/m2an/abs/2023/06/m2an230129/m2an230129.html) and [conservation laws with discontinuous flux](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04620).
