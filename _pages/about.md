Hi! Welcome to my personal website!

I am a PhD candidate in Mathematics at the [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Thiruvananthapuram](https://www.iisertvm.ac.in/), India.

In broad terms, my research focuses on developing and analyzing numerical schemes for hyperbolic conservation laws, a fundamental class of partial differential equations that govern various real-world physical systems. My interests include high-order finite volume schemes, their mathematical stability and convergence analysis, and computational implementation.

My current work focuses on high-order numerical schemes for conservation laws with non-local and discontinuous fluxes.
