Hi! Welcome to my personal website!

I am a PhD candidate in Mathematics at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Thiruvananthapuram, India. My research focuses on developing and analyzing numerical schemes for hyperbolic conservation laws, a fundamental class of partial differential equations that govern various real-world physical systems. My interests include high-order finite volume schemes, their mathematical stability and convergence analysis, and computational implementation.
